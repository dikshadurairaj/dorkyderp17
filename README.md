- 👋 Hi, I’m @dorkyderp17, or Diksha!
- 👀 I’m interested in cs. obviously.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to dip my toes into the professional CS world... and more coding languages. Currently I know Python and JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on literally anything. But mainly website management and data analysis projects! I'm also interested in AI and machine learning.
- 📫 How to reach me: shoot me a dm on insta or linkedin!
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: Before this year, I had literally no interest in computer science and didn't know a single thing about it.
